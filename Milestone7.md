# Milestone 7

---

### Overview

---

For the seventh milestone, my group and I finished and delivered our beta demonstration to the rest of the class and stakeholders. We worked down to the wire to attempt to connect our core features together, myself particularly focusing on connecting the AWS infrastructure to the circles library. Although being significantly behind in some areas, we were able to deliver to cohesive beta presentation, demonstrating the visualizations of the applications potential end product.


### Challenges

---
Despite our successfuly beta presentation, there's a general feeling of frustration as to the overall progress of our application. In previous weeks I have not contributed enough to the development of the application, which has not been helpful for the rest of the team members. Despite this, I plan to work extra on this project in the coming weeks, as I see the opportunity to deliver an effective application even beyond the activities within this course. There were also several, accidental yet unfortunate misshaps within our presentation, such as the slides moving back and forth and some of the functionality not being demonstrated. Next time we'll make sure to rehearse our presentation/demonstration more. 


### Successes

---

Despite my recent inactivity for this project in weeks leading up to the beta, this past week I've worked a lot and made substantial progress towards the development of the application. I was able to successfully connect the S3 service to circles, making successful POST and GET HTTP calls to store and retrieve object files. I also thought it would take much more work to get the objects displaying properly in a-frame after the retrieving them over the network, but it was actually fairly simple to implement. The next big hurdles are doing user management and connecting orbs/artifacts to users, but other than that the rest of the functionality are more smaller details and interactions. I'm also grateful for the patience and hard work of my team members, its been a busy couple of weeks and they've put in a lot of hard work.


### Hours Spent

---

From the last milestone, I have spent around 11.5 hours on this project, broken into the following categories:

- S3 infrastructure development â‡’ 9 hours
- Beta Presentation & Prep => 1 hour
- Meetings => 0.5 hours
