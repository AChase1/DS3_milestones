# Milestone 4

---

### Overview

---

For the fourth milestone, my group and I had completed the project proposal document and delivered the alpha presentation to the rest of the class, showcasing our ideas right before reading week. During reading week, we had a meeting to discuss next steps within our project. Steven and Charelle showcased several wireframes and ideations that will be used as reference for the MVP, primarily surrounding the UI/UX of uploading objects. I then walked the rest of the group through how to use the github repository (i.e., code reviews, branch management, etc.), as well as did an overview of the proposed software architecture using a makeshift UML diagram.

### Challenges

---

I still find that, even though they're very cool ideas, that some of the proposed ideas are extremely ambitious and far reaching without accounting for estimated time spent. I was also frustrated that we were unable to make any implementation progress over the reading week as we were swamped with school work from other courses and were dealing with personal issues (i.e., I was sick, again :/ ). As a result I really think we'll need to put our heads down and push through to make progress on the application, although the next few weeks are busy with other courses so we'll have to manage our time wisely.

### Successes

---

I was very pleased with the final outcomes of our proposal document and alpha presentation, we all did a great job during the presentation and putting together the document.

### Hours Spent

---

Up to this milestone, I have spent 9 hours on this project, broken into the following categories:

- Creating proposal document â‡’ 3 hours
- Creating, practicing, and delivering alpha presentation => 2 hour
- Brainstorming and creating makeshift UML diagram of proposed software architecture => 3 hours
- Group meeting during reading week => 1 hour
