# Milestone 1

---

### Overview

---

For the second milestone, our group met for a Discord call to further refine our scope and ideas, attempting to establish a more definitive feature list and conceptualization of our term project. We went over design ideas inspired by mood boards that our team created, as well as solidified certain features such as reactions (i.e., likes, sticky note messages, etc.) to various artistic pieces. Lastly, we created tasks for team members to complete for the next milestone.

### Challenges

---

One challenge I found during this milestone was coming to a collective understanding of what a feature would look like. Whether it was a misinterpretation or something else, I found that there were multiple times where one idea was mentioned or explained and someone else would agree, but repeat the idea in a way that was slightly different. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing, alternative perspective help foster creative growth, however it could present a challenge when it comes to its execution.

### Successes

---

It seems like we’re getting the ball rolling, solidifying our ideas and getting things organized. Everyone contributed some amazing and creative ideas, and it seems like everyone is invested and inspired to make this project a success. I feel very confident moving forward into the design phase of our project.

### Hours Spent

---

Up to this milestone, I have spent 1 hour on this project, broken into the following categories:
