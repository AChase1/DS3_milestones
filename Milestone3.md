# Milestone 3

---

### Overview

---

For the third milestone, my group and I had met during the class' work period on Friday the 7th of February to conduct a brainstorming session, solidfying our features and concepts. We were still unsure of the specifics of our proposed application, and thus felt it necessary to visualize and specifically define in more detail the features we wish to accomplish. Before the brainstorming session, I had visited my co-op's workplace to ask for advice from my colleagues surrounding object storage in MongoDB. They advised to use AWS S3 instead, as storing the objects in MongoDB would be counintuitive to the strengths of the database service. As a result, I conducted several of AWS's free training courses on their S3 service to gain a better understanding of the service, as well as studied its SDK for implementing it in JavaScript. During the brainstorming session, while the other members were conceptualizing the design of the application, I began connecting an AWS IAM account and an S3 bucket to a forked repository of the CirclesXR library. I also made sure to stay up to date with what the team was designing, making sure the ideas were feasible with the technologies we were planning to implement. Finally, we also began designing the tasks surrounding the proposal document and presentation.

### Challenges

---

One thing, that I don't think is necessarily a challenge but more of a concern, is that the rest of the team is coming up with lofty and creative ideas without ensuring its feasibility. I'm also having difficulty getting on board with some of the ideas, as I don't quite understand the creative design behind it. But the rest of the team seems excited about the ideas so I will do my best to understand their perspectives and realize their visions. For the future, I will try to communicate more with my team and make sure to remind them about the technical feasibility about some of their ideas, so that we can all feel confident about its implementation.

### Successes

---

One thing that went really well was the entire team appeared motivated to show up to an optional work period to brainstorm ideas and work on the project together. We all seemed excited at designing and implementing this project, and its great to see that all of the team members are willing and wanting to put in the effort to collaborate together.

### Hours Spent

---

Up to this milestone, I have spent 10 hours on this project, broken into the following categories:

- In-Person Work Period Session â‡’ 6 hours
- Discussions with Coop Colleagues => 1 hour
- Research and Courses on AWS S3 => 3 hours
