# Milestone 10 - Post Mortem

### Overview

Reflecting on the semester for this course, I learned essential skills and tools to be able to create interesting web-based VR applications, as well as practiced project management and teamwork skills. Together, Qing, Charelle, Steven, and I worked on creating a persistent cloud storage applictation called Keepsake, using open-sourced tools such as CirclesXR and A-Frame. Throughout the implementation of the project we practiced common project management practices, such as proposal, beta, and final demo presentations. For my personal learning development, I increased my knowledge in web-based networking and integrating services in existing packages, which significantly helps in my career development as a software developer.

### Challenges

Challenges that I encountered in this course were not entirely course related, and is more related to my personal routines and disciplines. I've noticed a pattern within myself that during school, I become lax in my discipline with staying on top of tasks or managing my time. During my co-op placement I was always on time, extremely prepared and organized, however I don't know why in school its not the same. It might have something to do with motivation, as I've definitely lost motivation and confidence in the effectiveness of this program.

Otherwise, I didn't really encounter many other issues, some headaches involving integrating services in other packages. But overall it wasn't too challenging. 


### Successes

I have to say I've been very happy with this course and the materials that I produced. I really enjoyed the philosophical inquiries within the VR realm, both in the resource reflections and the assignments. Despite some hiccups in my own discipline in completing tasks, I'm also very proud of the work my team and I did for the term project. We definitely bit off more than we could chew with our idea, but I'm proud that we were able to deliver a successful, working product in the end. I definitely see the potential of this product beyond the scope of this course, which is exciting to feel when creating a school project. This course was the only course that piqued my interesting from this semester, and I the course delivery was exceptional (as always with professor Anthony Scavarelli). I really think its important for us to learn how to work with other existing libraries, focusing more on the project management side of development, and I like how this course emphasized that aspect.

### Hours Spent

For the entirety of this course, with a generalized estimation, I probably spent on average 5-7 hours per week on this course, mostly on development and weekly meetings.
