# Milestone 1 - Blog Post

---

### Overview

---

For the first milestone in the term project for Design Studio III, my group and I met on a couple of Discord calls, discussing potential ideas and establishing the overall project administration. We established the roles of each team member and which software applications we’ll use. We also conducted a brief brainstorming session, discussing concerns and ideas surrounding a very interesting and bold concept that Charelle pitched to us. This brainstorming session produced actionable items for each team member, such as setting up the software applications for the project.

### Challenges

---

The biggest challenge I found during this Milestone was navigating the unfamiliarity with the team members. It was evident during our brainstorming sessions, where I noticed several long silences when someone would ask for opinions or ideas. It appears that we are still at a stage where we feel hesitant to converse freely and extrovertly, making it relatively difficult to bring many ideas and constructive opinions to the discussion. I have a strong feeling however that this will subside over the coming weeks.

### Successes

---

Apart from our slight unfamiliarity with one another, it appears that everyone is approaching the project and all team members with respect, sincerity, and commitment. Everyone is very nice and respectful, creating a great environment for constructive and effective discussions. They all also appear to show excitement and passion for delivering an incredible and effective VR application. I’m very excited at the opportunity to collaborate with them on this project, I’m very eager to see what we can build together.

### Hours Spent

---

Up to this milestone, I have spent a total of around 2.5 hours of dedicated work on the project. The hours are categorized as follows:

- Group Discord Calls ⇒ 1.5 hours
- Individual research on A-Frame and persistent storage ⇒ 0.5 hours
- Reviewing in class documentation about the term project ⇒ 0.25 hours
- Created the GitHub repository for the term project ⇒ 0.25 hours
