# Milestone 8

---

### Overview

---

For the eigth milestone, my group and I continued working on filling out the features of Keepsake. I specifically worked on persistently storing the orb according to the user, working towards being able to enter a user's gallery to load its objects. The core code implementations are relatively complete, just need to test and debug the functionality and it should be good for deployment. The rest of the group focused on other improvements within the application, such as Qing and Steven working on creating simplified geometry and updated textures, and Charelle is working on improved interactions (including HMD and mobile interactions).


### Challenges

---
At this current stage in the project, we haven't encountered many challenges. I would say at this point in the semester everyone is feeling overwhelmed with tasks and assignments, resulting in slightly deteriorated communication amongst team members. Other than that, everything appears to be going smoothly.


### Successes

---

I feel pretty good about the project at this state, we're making some good progress. Although I think it will be a sprint to the finish, some features are taking faster to implement than expected, so I think we'll be able to achieve the core functionalities we intended. 


### Hours Spent

---

From the last milestone, I have spent around 6 hours on this project, broken into the following categories:

- Orb, User, Artifact storage development development â‡’ 6 hours
