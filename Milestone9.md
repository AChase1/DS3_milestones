# Milestone 9

### Overview

For the ninth milestone, our group continued marching along with the development of Keepsake. With having several meetings to discuss progress and allocating more resources towards the development of the project, we're making steady and significant progress to the overall user experience. Qing and Steven have made great progress populating the environments with more narrative objects and themes, making the application feel more complete and whole. Charelle has made some significant progress in adding controls for mobile and HMD experiences, as well as began incorporating the frontend for interactive comments & reactions. As for myself, I was able to fully implement the persistent storage of a user's orb/gallery alongside its artifacts, and therefore fully completing the core functionalities of saving and sharing your gallery and objects with others.

### Challenges

As the deadline approaches, definitely feeling nervous about the overall progress, despite the many achievements we've completed in recent weeks. I think its just the perfectionist and anxiety within me to make sure everything is polished, as there are certain aspects of the user experience that I'm doubtful we'll have enough time to fully implement. Also, given the scramble and sprint towards the finish line, I feel like the organization and division of tasks has become a bit disorganized (understandably so).

### Successes

Despite some of my anxieties, I'm relieved to say we've completed the core functionalities of our application and are more focused on polishing smaller aspects to the user experience. The entire team is working very hard and have contributed amazing work in the recent week, I'm confident we can deliver an exceptional demonstration of our innovative VR product.

I've also been seriously comtemplating the future applications of this proof of concept, in both business and academic environments. Potentially being THE cloud storage system for VR, and with significantly further development in areas such as customization and storage, I see the opportunity for this application to give user's the ability to customize and share their own virtual environments. For example, an elementary school teacher customizing their environment with their own objects related to their curriculum (i.e., spaced themed gallery with planets) and sharing that with their students, who can use their phones, laptops, or HMD devices. For business applications this could become the Google Drive equivalent for the VR/AR space, using a SaaS model with tiered pricing for variable customizing and storage options. For academic contexts, this would allow researchers the ability to research not just how developers and students (those with pre-existing knowledge of VR/AR development and artistic strategies) use VR environments to create and share their projects, but how ANYONE (regardless of technical knowledge) would use VR environments to share their knowledge and creations with others (i.e., elementary school teachers with their students, grandmothers showing their overseas grandchildren their latest knitting project).

### Hours Spent

From the last milestone, I have spent around 11 hours on this project, broken into the following categories:

- Completed Orb, User, and Artifact storage development with testing/debugging ⇒ 10 hours
- Meetings ⇒ 1 hour
