# Milestone 6

---

### Overview

---

For the fifth milestone, my group and I were continued working towards a beta product consisting of our core features. Charelle put in a lot of work on the frontend of the application, as well as Qing and Steven worked on detailing some more models with more visually pleasing textures. We had several brief meetings (in person and through Discord voice chats) discussing status updates and expected outcomes and duties for each member.

### Challenges

---

I'm frustrated to say that I have contributed much to the development of this project in the past couple of weeks, due to prioritization (and sometimes the mismanagement) of other assignment, both in this course and other courses. It seemed that many assignments fell during these couple of weeks, and unfortunately this project fell amongst my priority list due to the low weighting value of the beta presentation. Irregardless, I need to spend more time and effort contributing to the project and helping my teammates. Also, as a team, we discussed on several occasions the frustrating challenges associated with using Circles XR, due to minimal and sometimes confusing documentation and organization of the codebase. In the future, we should ask more questions to the professor to clarify how to use Circles effectively and efficiently.

### Successes

---

Despite my lack of contribution, I'm very proud of the effort and contributions of my fellow teammates. They have done a considerable job creating the assets and functionality for the assignment. I would like to specifically shoutout Charelle, who spent many long hours implementing frontend code for user interactions in our Keepsake world, and who wrestled with Circles XR early into the mornings (despite not needing to).

### Hours Spent

---

From the last milestone, I have spent 1.75 hours on this project, broken into the following categories:

- Discord Voice Chat Meeting â‡’ 1 hour
- Demoing how to use Github and repository management => 0.5 hours
- In-person Meeting => 0.25 hours
